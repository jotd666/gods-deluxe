# Gods Deluxe

**Status**: Beta

### Features
- true color display
- reworked graphics
- (trying to be) extremely faithful to the Amiga/Sega original levels
- powerful level editor
- advanced programming API for complex level design
- localized (french, english, german & hungarian languages)

### Joystick support
- only available on windows
- depending on your JRE (32 or 64 bit) rename the "joystick_xxx.dll" file in the "bin" directory with "joystick.dll"
  (note: there's a 2-button control option, so joystick button 2 jumps when this control is set)
  
### Bugs/Limitations
- some (few) inaccuracies compared to the original game (see "original game bugs" section for more)
- Windows 7 & Vista: full screen mode does not work (no display at all)

### Title music tunes
Extract the music pack in "music" sub-directory to get a random tune in the menu screen

### Levels
- levels are unlocked only by completion of the previous ones.
- JOTD level set with 4 complete levels
- new RDG level set with 4 complete levels, 30 years after game release :)

### How to submit a bug
- First, please read the file "doc/BUGS.txt" before writing me about a bug. It is very likely to be on
  either of the list
- If the bug is not on the list, please report it
- If you witness any difference of behaviour with the original (example: difference in the puzzles),
  don't hesitate to report it. The exception being the monster AI,  because it is different from the
  original (I don't have the code!), but monsters involved in puzzles should not make the puzzle any
  different.
- If you find some secret stuff in the original game levels that is not or wrongly covered by the remake,
  please report it to me. Most seeked are special bonuses, speed bonuses, help bonuses that I may have
  forgot even if I played the game many times with different strategies and weapons and lives in order to
  trigger everything possible, and I also watched shortruns & longplays as a complement. I also gathered
  all the information from all the walkthrough, websites & forums available.
- I'm also interested on how the game is more and more difficult after you complete all the levels.
- If someone can shed some light about the scoring system, because I'm not getting it right 100% here.
